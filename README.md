# Insta-Ghost-Followers
This Python project identifies ghost followers on Instagram. The user adds login details to a .env file, then enters any username (including their own) in the terminal. The script shows the number of ghost followers and lists them. It uses Owner Avatar and Instagrapi to interact with Instagram.
